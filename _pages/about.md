### Bio:
Hello! My name is Bradley Jenner and I am studying Biotechnology (Bioinformatics Emphasis) at the University of California, Davis. Currently, I am working as a Bioinformatics Intern at the UC Davis Bioinformatics Core developing packages for evaluating HTStream preprocessing statistics. I am also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Gordon Lab in the UC Davis Department of Plant Pathology. This gives me the opportunity to apply my knowledge of Bioinformatics and assist in strawberry and fungal genomics studies. In my free time, I love to play guitar, program, and cook delicious vegan meals.
